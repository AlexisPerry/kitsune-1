# The Kitsune LLVM-based Compiler Infrastructure Version 0.8.1. 

This directory and its subdirectories contain source code for LLVM,
a toolkit for the construction of highly optimized compilers,
optimizers, and runtime environments.

This version is augmented to support the use of parallel intermediate
representations and modifications to how C++ program of various forms
are lowered into these IR forms.
